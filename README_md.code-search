# Safer  
### Incident Reporting & OSHA Compliance  
*AI-assisted. Human-approved. Fully auditable.*

## Overview
Safer is a multi-tenant compliance platform designed to help organizations accurately document workplace incidents, determine OSHA recordability with AI assistance, and generate required OSHA forms — while ensuring humans remain the final authority.

Safer is built for enterprises with many locations and regulated environments where auditability, transparency, and governance are non-negotiable.

## Core Principles
- AI provides advisory recommendations only
- Dual-model AI validation is required
- Human approval is mandatory before final classification
- All decisions are logged and auditable
- No cross-tenant data access
- Designed for regulatory trust, not automation hype

## Core Workflow
1. Incident is submitted at the location level
2. Data is normalized and validated
3. AI Model #1 evaluates OSHA recordability and provides rationale
4. AI Model #2 independently evaluates recordability
5. Discrepancies are flagged
6. Human reviewer approves, edits, or rejects
7. Reviewer feedback is captured
8. Approved incidents generate OSHA 301
9. OSHA 300 logs update automatically
10. OSHA 300A PDFs are generated by location
